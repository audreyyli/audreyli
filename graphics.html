                    <p class = "description">It was a challenge to combine the different theme elements that the Events department had envision. This yearâ€™s Korea Day theme was Underwater Dragon Palace and I found it difficult to combine the three main elements. However, after much trial and error, I was able to create this final piece, one that the entire WUKSA team and I love.</p>

                    <p class = "description">As the VP of Graphics for GRC, my responsibility was to create engaging graphics to inform our followers of new events and the impact social change can cause. I really enjoy this piece as it clean, minimalist, and straight-forward while staying within GRCâ€™s brand identity. </p>

                    <p class = "description">Inspired by 3D art, I wanted to try something new for this piece. I incorporated elements like the lightning bolts to make the piece look like it was approaching you. The glitch effect was added to make the piece look less 2-dimensional and I used a retro arcade machine as the center piece to fit the event; a retro arcade bar.</p>
